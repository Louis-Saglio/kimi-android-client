# Server drift automation

`scripts/` holds the `kimi-nightly-update` machinery (systemd timer on the
VPS, fires at 19:23 UTC = 03:23 Beijing time): it installs any new Kimi server
version (auto-update is disabled in `~/.kimi-code/tui.toml`), restarts the
server, fetches the upstream commits between the two releases from the public
`MoonshotAI/kimi-code` GitHub repo (tags `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code@<version>`)
into `~/.local/state/kimi-nightly-update/pending-changelog.md`, then a
headless agent uses that changelog to re-verify the wire protocol, rewrites
`docs/server-api.md`, files `todo/` tickets for breakage, and commits +
pushes the result. `docs/server-api.md` is the protocol reference — keep it
accurate when touching the data layer, and keep
`scripts/protocol-update-prompt.md` aligned with the doc's structure.
